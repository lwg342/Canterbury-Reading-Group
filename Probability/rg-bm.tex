Assume we have a family of random variables \(\Bqty{B_{t}(\omega): t \in \rinterval{0}{\infty}}\), such that 
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Stationary and independent increments;
    \item Gaussianity;
    \item Continuous path: a.s.-\(\omega\), \(B(t)\) is continuous.
\end{enumerate}

The first thing is to show that such process exists. 
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Kolmogorov's method;
    \item Hilbert Method;
    \item Weak Convergence of random walks. 
\end{enumerate}

It has the \key{Markov property} and \key{Strong Markov Property}. 

One of the good things about Brownian Motion is that \textit{functionals of the sample path} has calculable densities.
