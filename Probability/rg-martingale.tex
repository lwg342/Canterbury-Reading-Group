Conditional expectation is very important, it's a way to capture the dependence among random variables.

We begin with the definition of \key{filtration}. A filtration is a collection of sub-\(\sigma\)-algebra of \((\Omega, \mathcal{F}, P)\), such that 
\begin{equation*}
    \mathcal{F}_{n} \uparrow \mathcal{F}
\end{equation*}
It represents the accumulation of information over time.
